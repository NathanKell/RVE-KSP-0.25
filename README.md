RVE for 0.25 / RSS 8.2.1+
============

The, unfinished, state of my RVE project for KSP 0.25 using the very latest overhaul version from rbray (includes SS normals, dedicated atmosphere shader, "working" shadows, and other features).


Requirements:

	-Sarbians DDS loader
 	-RSS 8.2.1
 	-Latest EVE Overhaul (master zip)

Priority bugs/to do list:

	-Reduce memory footprint
	-Extend PQS terrain shader distance, too short on RSS
	-Fix "PuffBalls" glitch (VolumeHexRadius/VolumeSegmentDiv?
	-KSC Flickering issue when Cam01Range < 1, need comprimise

Includes WIP:

	-New cloud details with Transparency
	-Atmosphere shader in RSS, needs separated ground haze effect from other layers
	-Other planets unfinished/unchecked as with RVE 0.2.2 Dev.
