RVE for 0.25 / RSS 8.2.1+
============

The, unfinished, state of my RVE project for KSP 0.25 using the very latest overhaul version from rbray (includes SS normals, dedicated atmosphere shader, "working" shadows, and other features).

Bugs/to do list:

City day ATM issue
Shadow movement incorrect (Try fresh cloud config)
-RVE.cfg lines not being registered still...?
-Include/Revise working cam values for RVE.cfg
-Force UseSphericalSSM
-Extend PQS terrain shader distance, to short on RSS
-Fix Atmosphere shader far clipping plane end 'hole' visible below craft.


Includes WIP:

New cloud details with Transparency, still masses of wrapping distortion visible on high detail textures with transparency (Exact same issue as with large city textures).

Very unfinished ported version of Atmosphere shader to RSS, works at most times - still no lighting though!

Other planets unfinished/unchecked as with RVE 0.2.2 Dev.
